    <img src="https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Free-Guyjpg.webp?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5" alt="this is comedy photo" >
    <p>This year we were all not laughing, but some films still managed to dispel the permanent gloom and save the mood of the audience. 
        We recall the main characters of 2021 - the funniest, <br>
        saddest and touching comedies, which invariably proved that one should look to the future with optimism,
        and life, despite its worst manifestations, is capable of pleasantly surprising.</p>
    
    
    <h2>№ 1</h2>
    <h1>Vacation Friends</h1>

    <p>2021 wouldn’t be the same if the world wasn’t graced with the laid-back and hilarious Vacation Friends (or any other John Cena movie, for that matter). Couple Marcus and Emily (Lil Rel Howery and Yvonne Orji, respectively) are on vacation to Mexico when Marcus’ plan to propose to her goes awry. He decides to propose in the hotel lobby, where they meet another couple (Cena and Meredith Hagner) who seem a little too carefree and wild. Vacation Friends manages to turn a buddy comedy film into something with substance; its characters are fleshed out and it has an actual storyline that’s surprisingly good. The movie also offers the perfect mix of comedy and seriousness enhanced by the outstanding performances by its cast.</p>

    <h1>Don't Look Up</h1>

    <p>Don’t Look Up boasts what may be the ensemble cast of the year as it has Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Timothee Chalamet, Ariana Grande, and many more familiar faces. Lawrence is an astronomy student who discovers a comet that’s going to hit the Earth and kill everyone, and with her professor (DiCaprio), she tries to warn the government and media to stop what’s coming. The strength of the humor in the film lies in its political satire — the roadblocks that Lawrence and DiCaprio face are a corrupt government, the pervasive nature of social media and constructed news, capitalism, and a divided society on exactly is and isn’t real.</p>

    <h1>El Planeta</h1>

    El Planeta">
    <p>On the more artistic and surreal edges of comedy, writer/director Amalia Ulman's explores generational differences, economic anxieties, and complicated mother-daughter relationships with El Planeta. This gorgeous black-and-white dark comedy from Spain stars Ulman and her actual mother as Leo and Maria, a pair of down-on-their-luck women preparing to get evicted from their home. The film feels like a throwback to the defining indie movies of the '80s and '90s in America (Clerks, Slacker, Border Radio, Stranger Than Paradise), feeling like a feminist comedian's variation on Jim Jarmusch's filmography. Despite its cultural references, it's a highly unique, morbidly entertaining comedy-drama. You can stream El Planeta on HBO Max.</p>

    <h1>Bad Trip</h1>

    <p>Each year, the movie world remembers hidden cameras can either have one of two results: end poorly or turn out hilariously. Bad Trip is an example of it going well. Two best friends (Eric André and Lil Rel Howery) decide to take a road trip to New York City to rediscover a high school crush. The catch here is that they decided to steal a car belonging to an ex-convict sister, she gets upset, and then she decides to hunt them down after discovering her car is gone. As a prank comedy movie, Bad Trip is a spiritual cousin to Borat, although it’s less politically inclined and wonderfully relies on the strangers who’ve been unknowingly starring in a movie.</p>

    <h1>Shiva Baby</h1>

    <p>Writer/director Emma Seligman made a confident debut in 2021 with Shiva Baby, a feature-length anxiety attack of a film. With a star-making performance from Rachel Sennott, the angsty comedy follows the day in the life of a woman at a Jewish funeral, where she encounters an ex-lover and a current sugar daddy, struggles with her sexuality, is tormented by parents and acquaintances alike, and finds herself caught in lie after lie. The tension escalates in these extremely uncomfortable but hilarious film.</p>

    <h1>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</h1>

    <p>Two middle-aged Midwestern women have decided they’ve had enough of Nebraska. They’re going to leave and go on vacation for the first time, and, naturally, they’ve chosen to go to Florida. But everything starts to go south when a native to the area, traumatized by childhood bullying of her pale skin, decides to concoct an evil plan to kill everyone. Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar is unapologetic about what it’s about and doesn’t take itself seriously. As these two white women escape from the doldrums from everyday life, their lives seem almost too perfect in the hotel—complete with musical numbers by the staff. No cliché villain will ruin this vacation, and viewers are given the perfect amount of comedy for quality entertainment.</p>

    <h1>Red Rocket</h1>

    <p>The Florida Project’s director Sean Baker returned in 2021 with Red Rocket, a comedy-drama about a former porn star who has very few redeeming qualities. He chases the American Dream and leaves his former life behind to return to his hometown in Texas. However, he’s extremely unlikable, his ex-wife wants nothing to do with him, and his shamelessness is hilarious to watch. Some might think that this man has some redeeming qualities, but as the movie progresses, it shows he has a one-dimensional personality. And the viewer begins to root against him and his exploits, making this movie a spectacle of schadenfreude.</p>

    <h1>The French Dispatch</h1>

    <p>The French Dispatch was Wes Anderson's first anthology film of sorts, and while it may have worked better as a miniseries than one cohesive film, it is nonetheless a non-stop delight. With an even larger ensemble than usual, the film follows the misadventures of various reporters for the titular newspaper (run by Bill Murray). Wes Anderson's unique style and aesthetic has only become sharper and more refined with time, and every single frame of this film is a masterpiece of cinematography, lighting, coloring, costuming, and set design. It's a whimsical and breezy film, but stuffed to the brim with artistry and demands multiple viewings.</p>

    <h1>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</h1>
    <img src="https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ghostbusters-afterlife.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5" alt="a shot from the Ghostbusters: Afterlife">
    <p>The most recent installment in the Ghostbusters series, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, is set thirty-two years after the events of Ghostbusters II. Egon Spengler, one of the original members of the Ghostbusters, has left his farm to his daughter and her two children. There the children discover the equipment used by their grandfather and accidentally let loose a ghost, leading to catastrophic events. While this is a Ghostbusters film, it holds up respectfully to its predecessors while managing to sneak a few jokes in here and there. All in all, it is an enjoyable movie that breathes life into a classic series.</p>

    <h1>Free Guy</h1>

    <p>Ryan Reynolds is back, and he showed up ready to serve one of the most entertaining performances of the year. Guy (Reynolds) is a non-playable character in a video game just trying to live his best life. He doesn’t know that he’s in a video game and works as a bank teller, but when someone from the outside world tries to get his attention, the world as he knows it is turned upside down forever. Free Guy is a chaotic, but fun ride, an experience that feels like an homage to its non-comedic action movie predecessors like The Matrix. Strangely heartwarming, Free Guy is worthy of seeing at least once.</p>
